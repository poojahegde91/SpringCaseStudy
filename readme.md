## Seed code - Boilerplate for step 1 - Activity Stream Assignment

### Assignment Step Description

As a first step in building our Activity Stream application, we will create a monolithic application. 

A monolithic application is built as a single unit. Enterprise Applications are built in three parts: 
1. A database (consisting of many tables usually in a relational database management system), 
2. A client-side user interface (consisting of HTML pages and/or JavaScript running in a browser), 
3. A server-side application. 

This server-side application will handle HTTP requests, execute some domain specific logic, retrieve and update data from the database, and populate the HTML views to be sent to the browser. 

### Problem Statement

In this case study: Activity Stream Step 1, we will develop a monolithic application which will get the sender name, message from the user using a form (JSP/HTML), 
persist in MySQL Database and display all messages with their sender name, message content, timestamp of posting in a reverse chronological order (latest message first).

**Note: For detailed clarity on the class files, kindly go thru the Project Structure**
### Expected solution
 A form containing two text fields one for Sender Name, other for Message and a submit button, below to this will be a tabular column with the fields Sender Name, Message and Timestamp (This will be published in reverse chronological order). 
 When the user enters the Sender name, Message and clicks on submit button, it gets stored in the database and later render in tabular column.
 
### Following are the broad tasks:
1. Display the list of existing messages from the database. Each message should contain senderName, message, and timestamp. 
2. Send a message which should contain the senderName, message.
3. For hibernate configuration we require the following: Dialect,driver class,username,password,database URL, mapping classes.
4. Build the sessionFactory object based on the parameters from hibernate.cfg.xml file. Also, handle exception if the session factory object can't be created.

### Steps to be followed :

    Step 1: Clone the boilerplate in a specific folder in your local machine and import the same in your eclipse STS.
    Step 2: Add relevant dependencies in pom.xml file. 
        Note: Read the comments mentioned in pom.xml file for identifying the relevant dependencies.
    Step 3: Configure hibernate.cfg.xml file with the appropriate database's Username and Password, also create a schema which is mentioned as in hibernate.connection.url property.
        Note: Ensure the port number mentioned in the URL property and your database port number are same.
    Step 4: In ApplicationContextConfig.java add the required annotations, as well as add base packages to scan in @componentScan Annotation. Also define the bean for view resolver.
    Step 5: Specify Root config class in WebApplicationInitializer.java file.
    Step 6: Build the sessionFactory object based on the parameters from hibernate.cfg.xml file in HibernateUtil.java file.
    Step 7: In Message.java file (which is considered as Model class), annotate this class with @Entity Annotation and add @Id annotation to specify the primary key for the table.
    Step 8: In MessageRepository.java , create a hibernate session from HibernateUtil, as well create a method to save messages in database. 
                Also Write a method which is used to retrieve all messages from database
    Step 9: Run the JUnit testcases for MessageRepository (MessageRepositoryTest.java)
    Step 10: Annotate the MessageController.java with @Controller annotation, also define a handler method to read the existing messages from the database, 
                and to read the senderName and message from requested parameters and save the message in the message table in the database.
    Step 11: Run the MockMVCTest cases for MessageController (MessageControllerTest.java)
    Step 12: Design a form with 2 text boxes (one for sender name and other for Message) and a submit button. 
                A table which shows Senders name, Message and the Message posted date.

#### To use this as a boilerplate for your new project, you can follow these steps

1. Clone the base boilerplate in the folder **assignment-solution-step1** of your local machine
     
    `git clone https://gitlab-wd.stackroute.in/stack_java_activitystream/activitystream-step1-boilerplate.git assignment-solution-step1`

2. Navigate to assignment-solution-step6 folder

    `cd assignment-solution-step1`

3. Remove its remote or original reference

     `git remote rm origin`

4. Create a new repo in gitlab named `assignment-solution-step1` as private repo

5. Add your new repository reference as remote

     `git remote add origin https://gitlab-wd.stackroute.in/{{yourusername}}/assignment-solution-step1.git`

     **Note: {{yourusername}} should be replaced by your username from gitlab**

5. Check the status of your repo 
     
     `git status`

6. Use the following command to update the index using the current content found in the working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next commit.

     `git add .`
 
7. Commit and Push the project to git

     `git commit -a -m "Initial commit | or place your comments according to your need"`

     `git push -u origin master`

8. Check on the git repo online, if the files have been pushed
